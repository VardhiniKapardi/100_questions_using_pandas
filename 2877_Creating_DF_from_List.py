/*
Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called student_data. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.
The DataFrame should have two columns, student_id and age, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.
Input:
student_data:
[
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
Output:
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+

# Solution:
import pandas as pd

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns = ['student_id','age'])
